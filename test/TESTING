DEBUGGING

It's not greatly straight-forwards to debug a firefox plugin, so I've created a test program.

1.  Run test/flash and report any messages (this is statically linked so you should be able to 
    easily get a full backtrace running it under GDB. Also the messages should be on the terminal.
    

Debugging under Firefox:
1.  Ensure the shared library installed (libhal.so.1) is under the libraries search path, or add
    the relevant directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or equivalent on other systems).
    
2.  You may need to create and add a gdb-index to for the libxul.so file to the debug library of 
    libxul - this is described in the GDB info pages.
    
3.  When running Firefox the environment variable MOZ_DEBUG_CHILD_PROCESS needs to be set to 1.
    $ MOZ_DEBUG_CHILD_PROCESS=1 firefox
    
4.  When Firefox starts, navigate to the Adobe test page and start the DRM playback.

5.  As soon as the terminal prints a debug message giving the plugin-container process id, attach
    to this process in GDB (optionally set a catch point on load of libhal i.e. catch load libhal.*)
    
6.  Continue execution, get a backtrace.
