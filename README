This is the libhal-flash package.

It is based upon hal-0.5.14 package

WARNING - this is not a fully functional HAL layer!

The Adobe Flash web browser plugin for Linux relies upon libhal to provide
information required by libadobecp (which libflashplayer.so retrieves from the
internet) for playing back drm content.

Since HAL is no longer centric to most modern Linux systems (now we have UDev,
UDisks etc) - I'm only really providing this library because I see a growing
trend in the UK: ITV, Lovefilm and others are now using Silverlight rather than
Flash for their drm streams.
